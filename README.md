# Community GuideLines & Rules
This repository is created as a guidebook for members of the organization. Read the rules and info before anything else

- Creating a new repository requires a ```README``` that clearly explains what the repository does and its aim
- New members of individual repositories should add their names to the table of members in the repository
- To ask a question, create an issue with the label ```question```
- Be clear and stay on topic. Off-topic comments are a distraction and staying on topic helps produce positive and productive discussions.
